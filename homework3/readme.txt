How to RUN in terminal:
python spatwa1_homework3.py <no. of iterations> <learning_rate>
For example:
python spatwa1_homework3.py 30 1

README:
1)I have used learning rate as 1 in results.pdf since I have found it to be the best.
2)Comparing with naive bayes model, depeding on various parameters like iterations and learning_rate,
some accuracies are better in perceptron model, even upto 99% in some cases and some lower than naive bayes.
3)My code implementation in windows due to some floating point exceptions gives wrong accuracies sometimes.This shouldn't happen in linux though.
Please just restart the terminal and run once again if it gives wrong accuracies.
I wanted to get rid of this problem but I had some technical problems to connect to remote machine. 
4)The 2nd question is in the ML_homework3_question2.pdf
5)Results are in results.pdf
Thanks and sorry for any inconvenience!
