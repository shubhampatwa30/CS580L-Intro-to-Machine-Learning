There are 2 jupyter notebook files. 
One file can be run on local computer.(we have just used scikit learn) 
However, 2nd file has to be run on google colab since ,we have used 'fastai' library for experimentation and since, 
local machine are very tedious to setup for such libraries, just use colab. You will have to first upload the dataset to the colab directory.
